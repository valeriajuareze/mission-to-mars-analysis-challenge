# Mission to Mars Analysis Challenge

## Purpose
Adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images, using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
